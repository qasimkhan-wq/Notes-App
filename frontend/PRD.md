# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
*   **Product Vision:** To provide users with a simple, intuitive, and easy-to-use web-based note-taking application that allows them to quickly capture, organize, and retrieve their thoughts, ideas, and information, resembling the core functionality of Google Keep in a minimalist fashion.
*   **Core Purpose:** The product solves the problem of needing a straightforward digital space to jot down notes without unnecessary complexity, ensuring users can focus on content creation and retrieval.
*   **Target Users:** Individuals seeking a personal, no-frills note-taking tool for everyday use, who value simplicity and ease of access over advanced features.

**8. MVP SCOPE & DEFERRED FEATURES**
*   **8.1 MVP Success Definition**
    *   The core workflow of creating, viewing, editing, and deleting notes can be completed end-to-end by a new user.
    *   All features defined in Section 2.1 are fully functional.
*   **8.2 In Scope for MVP**
    *   FR-001: Note Management (Create, View, Edit, Delete, List, Search)
    *   FR-XXX: User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout, Password Reset, Profile Update, Account Deletion)
*   **8.3 Deferred Features (Post-MVP Roadmap)**
    *   **DF-001: Pin Notes**
        *   **Description:** Ability to "pin" important notes to the top of the list for quick access.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Not essential for the core note-taking validation flow; adds secondary organization functionality.
    *   **DF-002: Archive Notes**
        *   **Description:** Ability to move notes to an "archive" section, removing them from the main list without deleting them.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Not essential for the core note-taking validation flow; adds secondary organization functionality.
    *   **DF-003: Labels/Tags for Notes**
        *   **Description:** Users can assign custom labels or tags to notes for categorization and filtering.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Adds complexity to the data model and UI for filtering; secondary organization feature.
    *   **DF-004: Color-coding Notes**
        *   **Description:** Users can assign different background colors to notes for visual organization.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** UI enhancement, not core functionality.
    *   **DF-005: Rich Text Editing (e.g., Checkboxes, Formatting)**
        *   **Description:** Allow users to add formatting (bold, italics), bullet points, or checkboxes within note content.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Requires integration of a rich text editor, adding significant complexity to the input and display of note content.
    *   **DF-006: Image/Attachment Support**
        *   **Description:** Users can attach images or other files to their notes.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Adds complexity for file storage, upload, and display mechanisms.
    *   **DF-007: Reminders**
        *   **Description:** Users can set time-based or location-based reminders for notes.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** Adds significant complexity with scheduling, notifications, and potential location services.
    *   **DF-008: Collaboration/Sharing Notes**
        *   **Description:** Users can share notes with other users and collaborate on them.
        *   **Reason for Deferral:** High complexity involving access control, permissions, and potential real-time updates.

**9. ASSUMPTIONS & DECISIONS**
*   **Business Model:** Free-to-use for the MVP.
*   **Access Model:** Individual user accounts; no team or multi-tenant features for MVP.
*   **Entity Lifecycle Decisions:**
    *   **User:** Full CRUD with account deletion option, as this is a personal application and users should have full control over their data.
    *   **Note:** Full CRUD, as notes are user-generated content and the core purpose is to manage them. Hard delete is chosen for simplicity in MVP, assuming users want permanent removal.
*   **From User's Product Idea:**
    *   **Product:** A simple, easy-to-use web-based note-taking application resembling Google Keep's core functionality.
    *   **Technical Level:** The user mentioned "monog db atlas," indicating some technical awareness, but the request is for a functional product, not technical architecture.
*   **Key Assumptions Made:**
    *   The "simple manner and easy to use" implies a minimalist UI/UX focused purely on the core note-taking experience, without advanced features or complex interactions.
    *   "Resemble Google Notes" refers to the core functionality of creating, listing, and managing notes, not all advanced features of Google Keep.
    *   The application will be a web application accessible via any modern browser, providing a responsive experience across devices.
    *   User data (notes) will be private to each user.
